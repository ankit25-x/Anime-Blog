    <img class="poster" src="/images/naruto.jpg" />

    <p>One of the most popular and celebrated shows of all time Naruto and Naruto Shipudden have to talked about if you are talking about anime. Although some may say that the number of episodes is a herculean task, I would say that it is all worth the trouble! Naruto has 282 episodes which if one watches, makes it even more intriguing to watch the next 500! </p>

    <h2>2. Bleach</h2>

    <p>Started in the year 2004, this anime is one of the best storylines one can experience with the perfect villain arcs that will make you fall for it. Be wary of those filler episodes and you will have a lasting impression of this masterpiece!</p>

    <h2>3. Dragonball Z</h2>

    <p> No anime discussion is complete without our very own Goku and Vegeta! The amount of episodes are boundless with respect to the level of fun and entertainment one can expeierence from this series. We all sincerely hope that Goku keeps on finding new power and the show never ends!. P.S - And Vegeta too! </p>

    <h2>4. Death Note</h2>

    <p> The story is themed around a world where all humans have some or the other quirks where a boy narrates how he became the most powerful  hero on the planet! Need I say more?</p>


    <h2>4. Demon Slayer</h2>

    <img class="poster" src="/images/demonslayer.jpg" />

    <p>This is my personal favourite. The best one yet. The story begins with the protagonist's family dead and her sister turned into a demon. Its about their journey together to find the person responsible and becoming strong together.A must watch!</p>

    <h2>5. Jujutsu Kaisen</h2>

    <img class="poster" src="/images/jujutsu.jpg" />

    <p>Another interesting story that is making its mark in the world of anime. Only the first season of 24 episodes is out but those 24 won't let you leave the screens till the end! The combination of curses and sorcerers certainly blend well together, question is do you agree? </p>

    So that's all folks! I covered as much as I could for you too keep reading. Stay tuned for my next edition of best animes! Till then Sayonara!
