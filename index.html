    <p class="center 
    content">One of the most popular and celebrated shows of all time Naruto and Naruto Shipudden have
        to talked about if you
        are talking about anime. Although some may say that the number of episodes is a herculean task, I would say that
        it is all worth the trouble! Naruto has 282 episodes which if one watches, makes it even more intriguing to
        watch the next 500! </p>

    <h2 class="heading">2. Bleach</h2>

    content">Started in the year 2004, this anime is one of the best storylines one can experience with
        the perfect villain
        arcs that will make you fall for it. Be wary of those filler episodes and you will have a lasting impression of
        this masterpiece! The number of episodes on this show is 366! Although if you skip filler arcs you may finish it
        much easily.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">3. Dragonball Z</h2>

    <img class="poster 
    center" src="/images/dbz1.jpeg" />

    <p class="center 
    content"> No anime discussion is complete without our very own Goku and Vegeta! The amount of
        episodes are boundless with respect to the level of fun and entertainment one can expeierence from this series.
        With Dragonball Z, Dragonball Super and Dragonball Heroes the list is endless. We all sincerely hope that Goku
        keeps on finding new power and the show never ends!. P.S - And Vegeta too! </p>

    <h2 class="heading">4. Death Note</h2>

    <img class="poster 
    center" src="/images/deathnote.jpg" />

    <p class="center 
    content">Another gripping series involving a book that spells death for people. Its a short series
        but you absolutely won't regret this choice. The perfect villain and the perfect mastermind are waiting for you!
        Its just 2 seasons 0f 24 episodes each but it really proves that to make something great you don't need to have
        super long seasons and sagas.
    </p>


    <p class="intermission"> Well this was all contemporary, let me tell you more about some new concepts that have
        rocked the anime world!

        second! It has a total of 4 seasons with a fifth season in the making!</p>

    <h2 class="heading">2. Dr. Stone </h2>

    <img class="poster 
    center" src="/images/senku.jpg" />

    <p class="center 
    content">Based on an entirely new concept this story stands in its own league. A story where the
        modern age has been swept back to the stone age where everyone has turned to stone by some mystical rays. This
        makes the story unpredictable and the viewer question his own thoughts. Spoiler Alert- Those love fundamental
        science and applications are going to love this. It has currently only one season with 24 episodes.</p>

        family dead and her sister turned into a demon. Its about their journey together to find the person responsible
        and becoming strong together.A must watch! A single yet powerful season of 24 episodes and a follow up movie

    <p class="center 
    content">Another interesting story that is making its mark in the world of anime. Only the first
        season of 24 episodes is out but those 24 won't let you leave the screens till the end! The combination of
        curses and sorcerers certainly blend well together, question is do you agree? Available on netflix and other
        online portals.
